      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p>I'm a Mechanical Engineer and Mechanical Engineering grad student. I work as a development engineer for Kumho Tire and I am going for my Master's degree at The University of Akron.</p>
      <p>I've always liked figuring out how things work and solving problems. I did some coding in college and enjoyed it. My goal is to improve my Front-End skills and begin doing some work in my free time. If I really enjoy it, I might even make it a career.</p>
      <p>It is important to me that I better myself every day. I think that there is always something I can learn or improve to make tomorrow even better than the today.</p>
